# GUI Versions of some files are available here

You must first install the PySImpleGUI package with the following command

```sh
$ python -m pip install pysimplegui
```

GUI versions are a work in progress and may function differently to the regular scripts


Here is a sample printout of the VT_Scanner_GUI after completion
