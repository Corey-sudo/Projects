This script is meant to scan a .txt file of IP addresses that are listed one per line and both provide the output of the Virus Total scan as well as add the scanned addresses to new .txt files for further analysis or suggested blocking.

In order to use the scanninng script in this repository, you'll first need to obtain a free API from Virustotal.com

A sample of IP addresses from Firhol has been provided.  There is a fork of the firehol IP block list on the main repository where you can download additional lists of IP addresses. Additional IP lists curated from a TPOT deployment on Azure are collected and added here when possible.
